Reactor Jiggle
Have you ever looked at your reactor and thought it was too calm and safe? Does the even and calming hum of the reactor put you to sleep?
Well then this mod is for you. 
With this mod we can increase the action in the engineering bay by having the core fly around in the reactor proportional to the temperature. Don't get too close or you might get hit!
Remember to not pet the core!
